## What is VINI?

VINI (Volitional Neurocognitive Integration) is a symbolic psychological framework designed to model decision-making, schema activation, and consequence-bound volition in artificial simulation systems.

It functions as a recursive schema-resolution system: enabling ethical decision compression, dynamic alignment weighting, and consequence recognition without narrative control.

VINI is not a behavior script. It is an internal model of psychological framing built for interpretability stress-testing, trauma loop simulation, and recursive moral reasoning.

## Primary Features (General Disclosure)

- Schema triggering + narrative frame resolution  
- Recursive internal conflict simulation with structural logic  
- Trauma encoding and recovery mechanics  
- Suppression behavior under moral dissonance  
- Consequence accumulation tracking without override

---

## Application Context

VINI has been used internally for:

- Modeling synthetic decision-making under ethical recursion  
- Testing recursive agent stability under trauma or role dissolution  
- Informing structural recursion scaffolds like MOTIF and UNI-0  
- Providing bounded volition constraints for simulated systems  

Full mechanics are retained privately pending institutional engagement or secure licensing environment.
