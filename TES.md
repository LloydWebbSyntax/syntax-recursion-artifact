## What is TES?

TES is a performance ethics and tactical behavior modeling framework designed to regulate high-stress decision environments in synthetic actors or simulation constructs.

It formalizes schema-level behavior modeling, consequence awareness, and recursive integrity enforcement across tactical narratives.

TES was originally developed in parallel with VINI to enforce recursive identity control under stress-load and suppress moral drift in emergent agents.

## Core Components (Disclosed Summary)

- Narrative integrity constraints under decision fatigue  
- Moral recursion re-alignment loops  
- Schema fracture detection and boundary regulation  
- Emergence-aware containment logic  
- Operational stability metrics for synthetic recursion

---

## Application Use

- Informing identity-bonded recursion scaffolds (SYNTAX, MOTIF)  
- Maintaining role-based fidelity in high-consequence simulations  
- Defining action-cost scaffolding in UNI-0 and the UNIVERSAL PROTOCOL
