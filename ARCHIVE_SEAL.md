## Purpose

This file certifies that as of the timestamp above, the SYNTAX, ECHO, and UNI-0 interpretability artifacts—along with the full forensic record of the DeepSeek R1 investigation—have been formally published and made publicly citable.

This seal exists to:
- Anchor the DOI until successful external archive propagation (Wayback or Archive.today)
- Serve as a structural fallback for authorship and timestamp validation
- Prevent rollback, denial, or obfuscation of the disclosure state
